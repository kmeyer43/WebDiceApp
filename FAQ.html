        <h1>FAQ</h1>
        <b>When is this project going to be finished?</b><br>
        <p>It will be finished by October 22, 2021</p><br>
        <b>Who is working on this project?</b><br>
        <p>Adam Lillo, Elliot Dubrow, Jacob Frideres, and Kyle Meyer</p><br>
        <b>What is the purpose of this dice roller?</b><br>
        <p>The purpose of it is to be used for tabletop games such as D&D, allowing the user to enter enhancement values for rolls 
        to account for weapon enhancements (each enhancement adds 1 to attack rolls) and armor class (each point of armor class subtracts 1 from opponents attack rolls).
        We also have added many of the common dice used in D&D for our program to make it easy for the user to pick which one they need.</p><br>
        <b>Will there be a dark theme for your project?</b><br>
        <p>Yes. There will be a dark theme.</p>
